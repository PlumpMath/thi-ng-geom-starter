* Literate Programming

This project was created with

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  lein new chestnut thi-ng-geom-starter -- --reagent
#+END_SRC

Chestnut seems to do its own initial git commit, so if a repository of the same name is created on GitHub, it just takes a quick

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/thi-ng-geom-starter.git
#+END_SRC

followed by a ~git push -u origin master~ to get everything synchronised.

A couple of notes on the initial project build:

- We're using [[https://github.com/plexus/chestnut][Chestnut]] rather than plain [[https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel][Figwheel]] because it seems to bring up a proper ClojureScript REPL that we can connect into from Emacs (in fact, we can switch between them by saying ~(browser-repl)~ from Clojure and ~:cljs/quit~ from ClojureScript)
- We've gone [[https://reagent-project.github.io/][Reagent]] rather than [[https://github.com/omcljs/om][Om]] for simplicity
- We've only provided a flat namespace (~thi-ng-geom-starter~) rather than a qualified namespace (~eu.cassiel/[...]~) because of a bug in Chestnut which messes up the directory structure for qualified names

To get a fully functioning REPL for CIDER, I've added the following plugin dependencies:

- ~[cider/cider-nrepl "0.9.1"]~
- ~[refactor-nrepl "1.1.0"]~
